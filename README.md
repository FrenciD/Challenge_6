# Challenge_6
in this challenge I use the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve weather data from the cities list. Then, I create a series of scatter plots to showcase the relationships as follows:

Latitude vs. Temperature
Latitude vs. Humidity
Latitude vs. Cloudiness
Latitude vs. Wind Speed

Added the linear regression for each relationship. Separated the plots into Northern Hemisphere and Southern Hemisphere, and create a series of scatter plots. 

Northern Hemisphere:  
                      Latitude vs. Temperature
                      
                      Latitude vs. Humidity
                      
                      Latitude vs. Cloudiness
                      
                      Latitude vs. Wind Speed
  

Southern Hemisphere:  
                      Latitude vs. Temperature
                      Latitude vs. Humidity
                      Latitude vs. Cloudiness
                      Latitude vs. Wind Speed

Part 2: VacationPy
 
 
 I use Jupyter notebooks, the geoViews Python library, and the Geoapify API. To create map visualizations.

Create a map that displays a point for every city in the city_data_df DataFrame. Each point shows the humidity in each city.
Reduced the city_data_df DataFrame to find your ideal weather condition.

 A new DataFrame was created to store the city, country, coordinates, and humidity.

For each city,I use the Geoapify API to find the first hotel located within 10,000 meters of your coordinates.
